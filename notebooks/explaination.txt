Simple Explanation: How We Get Next Day Demand & Price
First, One Important Truth (Please Read)

👉 We cannot know the future.
👉 We can only make a reasonable guess based on past days.

That is exactly what companies do.

PART 1 — What Is “Demand” in Our Project?

We do NOT know real sales, so we use a trick.

Our rule:
Demand ≈ Number of new reviews in a day

Example:
Day	Reviews
Day 1	100
Day 2	108

So:

Demand on Day 2 = 108 − 100 = 8


That means ~8 people bought the product (approx).

PART 2 — How We Guess Tomorrow’s Demand (Very Easy)

We just look at recent days and take the average.

Example (7 days demand):
[6, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 7]

Our guess for tomorrow:
(6+7+8+9+7+8+7) / 7 = 7.4


So we say:

👉 Tomorrow’s demand ≈ 7 people

This is called a baseline prediction.

No ML. Just logic.

PART 3 — How We Decide Tomorrow’s Price (Very Easy)

We do NOT predict price.
We try few prices and see which gives more money.

Step 1 — Take Today’s Price

Example:

Today price = ₹60,000

Step 2 — Try 3 Prices
Price Option
₹57,000 (lower)
₹60,000 (same)
₹63,000 (higher)
Step 3 — Simple Rule (Important)

We assume:

Lower price → more demand

Higher price → less demand

Example rule:

If price goes down 5% → demand goes up 10%


This is a temporary assumption.

Step 4 — Calculate Money (Revenue)
Price	Demand	Money
57,000	8	456,000
60,000	7	420,000
63,000	5	315,000
Step 5 — Choose Best Price

The price that gives maximum money is:

👉 ₹57,000

So this becomes tomorrow’s recommended price.

PART 4 — What We Store in Database

Every day, we store:

1️⃣ Raw Data

price

reviews

rating

2️⃣ Calculated Data

daily demand (review difference)

predicted next day demand

recommended price

PART 5 — Very Important Rule (Remember This)
With only 7 days data:

❌ Do NOT use ML
✅ Use simple average logic

After ~30 days:

✅ Use ML model
❌ Stop using assumptions

PART 6 — One-Line Memory Rule (SAVE THIS)

First collect data → then take average → then try few prices → pick best → later replace logic with ML

That is the whole project.

PART 7 — What You Will Say in Interviews (Simple)

“Initially, I used average-based forecasting and rule-based price selection. As more data became available, I switched to ML-based demand prediction.”

This is a perfect answer.

PART 8 — What You Should Do Next (Very Simple)
Your next coding step:

Load data from SQL

Calculate daily demand

Take last 7 days average

Try 3 prices
