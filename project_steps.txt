COMPLETE PROJECT STEPS (FROM NOW TO FINISH)

You already completed:
✅ Scraping
✅ Database schema
✅ Data inserted into SQL

Now we continue correctly.

PHASE 1 — DAILY DATA PIPELINE (FOUNDATION)
STEP 1 — Daily Scraping (Already doing, continue forever)

Every day:

Scrape same Flipkart URL(s)

Get:

price

discount

rating

reviews

stock

Insert new row into SQL

Never update old rows

One row = one day

👉 This builds history (most important asset).

STEP 2 — Load SQL → Pandas (Daily)

Read SQL table into Pandas

This is your ETL entry point

SQL → Pandas → Cleaning → Features → Back to SQL

PHASE 2 — ETL PIPELINE (CORE ENGINE)
STEP 3 — Data Cleaning

After loading into Pandas:

Convert data types (price, rating, reviews)

Sort by product + date

Remove duplicate rows

Ensure:

price > 0

reviews ≥ 0

rating between 1–5

👉 This prevents silent bugs.

STEP 4 — Create Demand (MOST IMPORTANT)

Demand = new reviews per day

daily_demand = reviews(today) − reviews(yesterday)


First day = 0

Negative values → make 0

This is your target variable.

STEP 5 — Create Price Features

From price:

price_change (today − yesterday)

price_percent_change

discount_flag (yes/no)

These explain why demand changes.

STEP 6 — Save Features Back to SQL

Create a new table:

daily_features


Store:

product_id

date

selling_price

daily_demand

price_change

discount_flag

👉 This becomes your ML-ready dataset.

PHASE 3 — BASELINE PREDICTION (WITH 7 DAYS DATA)
STEP 7 — Predict Next Day Demand (NO ML)

With only 7 days, use average.

next_day_demand =
average(daily_demand of last 7 days)


This is honest and correct.

STEP 8 — Decide Next Day Price (RULE-BASED)

You do NOT predict price.
You try few prices and pick best.

Example:

Today price

5% lower

5% higher

For each price:

revenue = price × predicted_demand


Pick price with maximum revenue.

STEP 9 — Store Predictions

Create table:

predictions


Store:

date

predicted_demand

recommended_price

method = "baseline"

PHASE 4 — AUTOMATION (REAL MLOps)
STEP 10 — Automate Everything

Use:

Windows Task Scheduler / cron

Daily job:

Scrape

Insert SQL

Run ETL

Generate prediction

Save result

👉 No manual work.

PHASE 5 — ML (ONLY AFTER ~30 DAYS)
STEP 11 — Train Demand ML Model

After ~30 days data:

Inputs:

price

discount

past demand

rolling averages

Target:

daily_demand

Train:

Linear Regression / XGBoost

STEP 12 — Replace Baseline with ML

Logic:

if days < 30:
    use baseline
else:
    use ML model


This is production-grade logic.

PHASE 6 — PRICE OPTIMIZATION (ADVANCED)
STEP 13 — ML-Based Price Recommendation

Use ML to predict demand for each price option

Pick price with max revenue

This becomes real pricing intelligence.

PHASE 7 — API & DASHBOARD
STEP 14 — FastAPI

Endpoints:

/predict-demand

/recommend-price

Return:

next day demand

recommended price

method used

STEP 15 — Streamlit Dashboard

Show:

Price history

Review growth

Demand prediction

Recommended price

PHASE 8 — DEPLOYMENT (FINAL)
STEP 16 — Docker

Dockerize:

Scraper

ETL

API

Dashboard

STEP 17 — AWS Deployment

EC2

RDS

Environment variables

(Optional)

CI/CD later

ONE-PAGE MEMORY RULE (SAVE THIS)

Collect data daily → clean → calculate demand → take average → try prices → pick best → later replace with ML

That is your entire project logic.

WHAT YOU CAN SAY IN INTERVIEWS (VERY IMPORTANT)

“I built a full pipeline that continuously collects e-commerce data, derives a demand proxy using review velocity, applies baseline forecasting initially, and later transitions to ML-based demand prediction and price optimization.”

This is strong.
